    <string name="p1">COVID-19 is a disease caused by a new strain of coronavirus. ‘CO’ stands for corona, ‘VI’ for virus, and
‘D’ for disease. Formerly, this disease was referred to as ‘2019 novel coronavirus’ or ‘2019-nCoV.’
The COVID-19 virus is a new virus linked to the same family of viruses as Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome (SARS) and some types of common cold.</string>
    <string name="p2">
The virus is transmitted through direct contact with respiratory droplets of an infected person (generated
through coughing and sneezing). Individuals can also be infected from and touching surfaces
contaminated with the virus and touching their face (e.g., eyes, nose, mouth). The COVID-19 virus may
survive on surfaces for several hours, but simple disinfectants can kill it.</string>

We are learning more about how COVID-19 affects people every day.  Older people, and people with
chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes and heart disease, appear to be more at risk of developing
severe symptoms.  As this is a new virus, we are still learning about how it affects children. We know it is
possible for people of any age to be infected with the virus, but so far there are relatively few cases of
COVID-19 reported among children. This is a new virus and we need to learn more about how it affects
children. The virus can be fatal in rare cases, so far mainly among older people with pre-existing medical
conditions.</string>
    <string name="p4">
There is no currently available vaccine for COVID-19. However, many of the symptoms can be treated
and getting early care from a healthcare provider can make the disease less dangerous. There are
several clinical trials that are being conducted to evaluate potential therapeutics for COVID-19.</string>
